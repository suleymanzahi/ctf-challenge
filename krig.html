                The Meuse-Argonne Offensive was a crucial Allied operation during the final stages of World War I,
                running from
                September 26 to November 11, 1918, as part of the larger Hundred Days Offensive that ended the war. It
                was the
                largest and deadliest campaign in U.S. military history, involving 1.2 million American, French, and
                Siamese
                troops and resulting in over 350,000 casualties, including 26,277 American lives.

                The offensive was a key engagement of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), commanded by General
                <b>John J. Pershing</b>, and marked the AEF's most significant contribution to the war. Despite its limited
                scope compared to
                other battles on the Western Front, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive demonstrated renewed Allied
                determination,
                especially with the support of fresh but inexperienced U.S. forces. Poor tactics, inexperience, and the
                Spanish
                flu exacerbated American losses.

                American forces attacked the German positions along the Meuse River and Argonne Forest, advancing toward
                Sedan. These actions, along with British,
                French, and Belgian offensives elsewhere, forced German retreats and directly contributed to the
                Armistice of
                November 11, 1918, ending the war.
