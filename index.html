    <p>
      Nothing changes if nothing changes. You can not change you life unless you change something. If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always
      got. To get something you've never had, you have to do something do you've never done before. If you think the price
      of winning is too high, wait until you get the price of regret. Our competition has never been with anyone else, our
      true competition has only ever been our bad habits, our procrastination, our lack of discipline, our fear and our
      self-doubt. When it feels scary to jump in, that is exactly when you jump.
      <br>
      How bad do you want it? The price you need to pay to achieve greatness is obsession. The kind that makes you willing
      to risk everything. There's two options. To continue forward, pushing upward. If you do, that dream is giving birth
      and forever you will live in the reality of it. If you stop, quit, throw the towel, I promise you there's no distance
      you can travel far enough to find that dream again, for it is dead. And in its death it is replaced by regret.
      The choice is yours, what will <em>YOU</em> do?
